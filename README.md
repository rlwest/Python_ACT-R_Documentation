# Python_ACT-R_Documentation

This repository is intended to provide documentation of Python ACT-R to help users and researchers understand how Python ACT-R works. Documentation of the Python ACT-R system will be written in the Wiki page. Additionaly commented source code will be included in the CommentedCode directory.

Python ACT-R is an implementation of the cognitive architecture ACT-R written in Python by Terrence C. Stewart and Robert L. West at Carleton University, Canada. It's also a model system packaged into ccmsuite. The system can then run one or more models structured using the ACT-R framework in an environment. The source code can be found here: https://github.com/tcstewar/ccmsuite.git 

Having ACT-R agents run in an environment allows for multiple agents to interact and use of Python results in a clean and simple interface to program and run agents.

Note: 
This page is a work-in-progress and currently focuses on the python2 version, but will later include python3 and differences between the two versions.
