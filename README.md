# Python_ACT-R_Documentation

This repository is intended to provide documentation of Python ACT-R to help users and researchers understand how Python ACT-R works. Documentation of the Python ACT-R system will be written in the Wiki page. Additionally commented source code will be included in the CommentedCode directory.

Python ACT-R is an implementation of the cognitive architecture ACT-R written in Python by Terrence C. Stewart and Robert L. West at Carleton University, Canada. It's also a model system packaged into ccmsuite. The system can then run one or more models structured using the ACT-R framework in an environment. The source code can be found here: 

* Python 2 version: https://github.com/tcstewar/ccmsuite.git
* Python 3 version: https://github.com/CarletonCognitiveModelingLab/CCMSuite3

Having ACT-R agents run in an environment allows for multiple agents to interact and use of Python results in a clean and simple interface to program and run agents. For official introductory tutorials see: https://github.com/rlwest/Python_ACT-R_Tutorials/wiki. For code examples see: https://github.com/rlwest/Learning-Models.

ACT-R information can be found at: http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/


Note:
This page is a work-in-progress and is shifting to focus on the python3 version, but will later include version differences for python2 and 3.
